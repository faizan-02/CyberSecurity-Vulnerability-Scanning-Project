# CyberSecurity-Vulnerability-Scanning-Project
Vulnerability Scanning
This project assessed the security risks of the official website of Bahria University and the commercial platform Yahoo.com using Nessus Essential. I conducted both Basic Network Scan and Host Discovery scan on both websites to uncover potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. The analysis revealed that the Bahria University website had three issues related to its SSL/TLS certificates, which are critical for securing data transmission. Yahoo.com was found to be using outdated TLS versions, posing risks of data interception or tampering. Additionally, two minor security points were identified for both sites, highlighting areas for improvement. The findings emphasize the need for regular security monitoring and assessment to protect websites against evolving threats. Nessus Essential proved to be a valuable tool in identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities, helping to ensure the integrity and protection of online platforms.
